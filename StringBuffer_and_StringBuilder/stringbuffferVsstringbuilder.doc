1 StringBuffer and StringBuilder are classes in Java used for manipulating strings. 

2 StringBuffer is synchronized, ensuring thread safety but may be slower due to locking mechanisms.

3 StringBuilder is not synchronized, making it faster but not thread-safe. 

4 Both classes provide methods for appending, inserting, deleting, and modifying strings, offering flexibility in string manipulation operations.

5 StringBuilder typically preferred for single-threaded operations due to its faster performance.




********** Example for StringBuffer *************

// Creating a StringBuffer object
StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer("Hello");

// Appending text to the StringBuffer
stringBuffer.append(" World");

// Inserting text at a specific position
stringBuffer.insert(5, ", ");

// Deleting text from the StringBuffer
stringBuffer.delete(5, 7);

// Converting StringBuffer to String
String result = stringBuffer.toString();

System.out.println(result); // Output: Hello, World



************ Example for StringBuilder **********

// Creating a StringBuilder object
StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder("Java");

// Appending text to the StringBuilder
stringBuilder.append(" is");

// Inserting text at a specific position
stringBuilder.insert(4, " awesome");

// Deleting text from the StringBuilder
stringBuilder.delete(6, 11);

// Converting StringBuilder to String
String result = stringBuilder.toString();

System.out.println(result); // Output: Java awesome




In both examples, we create instances of StringBuffer and StringBuilder, perform various operations such as appending, inserting, and deleting text, and finally convert them to strings using the toString() method to print the results.
