1. In Java, an exception is a disruptive event that occurs during the execution of 
a program, interrupting its normal flow. It's an instance of a problem that 
arises while the program is running, such as arithmetic errors, null pointer 
accesses, or resource overflows.

2. Exceptions are objects in Java that encapsulate information about an error 
event, including its type and the state of the program when the error 
occurred.
