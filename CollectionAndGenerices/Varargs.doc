number of arguments.

2. Declared using an ellipsis (...), e.g., void 
method(int... nums).

3. Internal Handling: Treated as arrays, e.g., 
int... nums is int[] nums.

4. Placement: Must be the last in the method's 
parameters.

5. Usage: Call with varying argument counts, 
e.g., method(1, 2) or method().
