AccessModifier in java

1. Types: The four access modifiers are public, protected,
default (no modifier), and private.

2.Public: The public modifier allows access from any other
class. For classes, it means they can be accessed from any
other package.

3.Protected: The protected modifier allows access within the
same package and subclasses.

4.Default: If no access modifier is specified, it's the default,
allowing access only within the same package.

5.Private: The private modifier restricts access to the defining
class only.

6.Class-Level Access: Only public and default (no modifier)
access modifiers are applicable for top-level classes.

7.Member-Level Access: Methods, constructors, and variables
can use all four access modifiers to control visibility.
