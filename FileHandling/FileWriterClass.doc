1. FileWriter is used for writing streams of characters to files. 

2. It's a character-based stream, which means it's best used for 
writing text rather than binary data.

3. Constructors:
• FileWriter(String fileName): Creates a FileWriter object given 
the name of the file to write to.
• FileWriter(File file): Creates a FileWriter object given a File 
object.


4. Common Methods:
• write(int c): Writes a single character.
• write(char[] cbuf): Writes an array of characters.
• write(String str): Writes a string.
• flush(): Flushes the stream, ensuring all data is written out.
• close(): Closes the stream, releasing any associated system 
resources


Answer in True/False
1. A method that throws a checked exception must declare the exception 
using the throws keyword in its signature. 
2. It is possible to handle more than one type of exception in a single catch 
block. 
3. The finally block is always executed, even if a return statement is 
encountered in the try or catch block.
4. If both try and catch blocks have return statements, the finally block will not 
execute. 
5. You can throw an exception of any type, including custom exceptions, using 
the throw keyword.
6. If a try block does not throw any exception, the catch block is executed for 
cleanup purposes. 
7. Unchecked exceptions are a direct subclass of Throwable.
8. A catch block can exist independently of a try block. 
9. You can nest try blocks within another try block. 
10.The throw keyword is used to propagate an exception up the call stack.
