1. Priority Levels: Java threads have priority levels from 1 
(lowest) to 10 (highest), with a default value of 5.

2. Influence on Execution: A thread's priority suggests the 
importance of a thread to the scheduler, though it 
doesn't guarantee the order of execution.

3. Set and Get Priority: Use setPriority(int) to change a 
thread's priority and getPriority() to retrieve it.
