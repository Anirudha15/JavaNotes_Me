1. What is a Thread: A thread in Java is a small part of a 
program that can run at the same time as other 
parts.

2. Purpose: Threads help a program do many things at 
once, like handling many users or doing different 
tasks simultaneously.

3. Creating Threads: You can make a thread by using the 
Thread class or the Runnable interface.

4. Using Threads: Use threads for tasks that can happen 
at the same time, like managing many requests or 
splitting up a big job.

5. Thread Talk: Threads can talk to each other using 
wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() to coordinate their 
work.
