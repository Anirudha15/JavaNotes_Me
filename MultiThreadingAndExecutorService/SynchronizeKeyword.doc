1. Mutual Exclusion: The synchronize keyword in Java 
ensures that only one thread can execute a block of 
code at a time, providing mutual exclusion and 
preventing race conditions.

2. Object Lock: When a thread enters a synchronized 
block or method, it acquires a lock on the object or 
class, depending on whether the method is an 
instance method or a static method.

3. Visibility: It ensures that changes made by one thread 
to shared data are visible to other threads
