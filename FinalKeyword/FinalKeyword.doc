In Java, the final keyword can be applied to variables, methods, and classes, indicating that they cannot be changed or overridden./


1 Variables: A final variable's value cannot be modified after initialization. It must be assigned a value exactly once.


eg
   final int constantValue = 10;


2 Methods: A final method cannot be overridden in subclasses, providing stability to method implementations.

eg
   public final void finalMethod() {
    // Method implementation
}

3
Classes: A final class cannot be subclassed, ensuring that its implementation remains unchanged.

eg  
public final class FinalClass {}{
    class implementation
}
