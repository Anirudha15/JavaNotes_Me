1. Variable Pass by Value:
• Java's default method.
• Copies argument's value to function's 
parameter.
• Changes in function don't affect original 
variable.

2. Objects and References:
• Java passes the reference's value for objects.
• Modifications to objects in methods affect 
originals.

3. Primitive Types:
• Always passed by value.
• In-function changes don't impact originals.
