1.Method overriding occurs when a 
subclass provides a specific 
implementation for a method already 
defined in its superclass.

2.Run-Time Polymorphism: Overriding is 
a basis for runtime polymorphism, 
where the method call is determined 
by the object's type at runtime.


3. Superclass Reference: An overridden 
method can be called through a 
superclass reference holding a subclass 
object

1. Same Signature: Overridden methods must have 
the same name, return type, and parameters as 
the method in the parent class.

2.Access Level: The access level cannot be more 
restrictive than the overridden method's access 
level.

3.@Override Annotation: This annotation is 
optional but helps to ensure that the method is 
correctly overridden
