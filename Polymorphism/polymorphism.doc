1.Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to 
respond to the same message (method call) in different ways.

2. Flexibility: Allows for writing more flexible and reusable code.

3. Simplicity: Enables developers to write more simple and readable 
code by using the same interface for different underlying data 
types.


Two types of Polymorphism

1.Compile-Time Polymorphism: Achieved through method 
overloading or operator overloading.

2.Run-Time Polymorphism: Achieved through method overriding, 
where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method 
already defined in its superclass.
