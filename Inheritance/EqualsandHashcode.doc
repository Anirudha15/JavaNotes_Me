1. equals() Method: Used for logical equality checks between objects. By default, it
compares object references, but it's commonly overridden to compare object states.

2. hashCode() Method: Generates an integer hash code representing an object. It's
crucial for the performance of hash-based collections like HashMap.

3. Equals-Hashcode Contract: If two objects are equal according to equals(), they must
have the same hash code. However, two objects with the same hash code aren't
necessarily equal.

4. Overriding Both: If equals() is overridden, hashCode() should also be overridden to
maintain consistency between these methods.
