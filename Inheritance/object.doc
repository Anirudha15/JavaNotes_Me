1.Root Class: The Object class is the parent class of all classes in Java, forming
the top of the class hierarchy.

2.Default Methods: It provides fundamental methods like equals(),
hashCode(), toString(), and getClass() that can be overridden by subclasses.

3. String Representation: The toString() method returns a string
representation of the object, often overridden for more informative
output.
