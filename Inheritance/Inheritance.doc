1.Inheritance allows a new class (subclass) to
inherit features from an existing class
(superclass).

2.Code Reusability: It enables subclasses to use
methods and variables of the superclass,
reducing code duplication.

3.Access Control: The protected access modifier is
often used in inheritance to allow subclass access
to superclass members.
